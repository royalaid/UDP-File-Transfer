While Running:
    user input
        timeout
        port
        window element num = N
        *seg size static

    listen for req
        rec initial
            process req
            locate file
            create window
            load N bytes into window

        send Server Init

        while fileIncomplete:
            for x in window:
                send x

            some timeout magic:
                if recv ack:
                    verify ack
                        checksum, seq, etc???
                        if fileIncomplete: <---- not just boolean, actually check seq
                            drop ack seg from window
                            add next seg to window
                        else:
                            set fileIncomplete False
